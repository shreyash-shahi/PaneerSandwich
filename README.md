Today I am going to give you the recpie of how to make paneer sandwich with the list of ingredients.
It is my favourite snack and I love to take it to my school in my lunch box. I hope you like my recepie.
The ingredients for making a paneer sandwich are: 4 slices brown bread, 1 tablespoon butter,
                                                  1/2 cup crumbled paneer, 3 tablespoon sauce of your choice,
                                                  2 tablespoon fine chopped tomatoes, 3 tablespoon boiled sweet corn, 1/4 cup grated carrot, 2 tablespoon fine chopped cucumber, 2                                                   tablespoon fine chopped coriander leaves,
                                                  1 chopped green chilli, 1/4 teaspoon salt,
                                                  1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon chaat masala and
                                                  2 tablespoon green chutney (to spread).
Now to the main recepie. Add 1/2 cup crumbled paneer to a large mixing bowl. Now add 1/4 cup grated carrot,
2 tablespoon fine chopped tomatoes, 3 tablespoon boiled sweet corn, 2 tablespoon fine chopped cucumber to it
and mix them all. Next add 2 tablespoon fine chopped coriander leaves, 1 chopped green chilli,1 tablespoon 
sauce of your choice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon chaat masala.
Now, mix everything well. You can taste it and add more salt if you want. Now, take 2 slices of bread and 
spread any sauce of your choice on one slice and green chutney on other slice. Then spread the mixture on
one slice and cover it with other slice. Butter the bread slices and toast them in a sandwich toaster or 
you can also grill them on tawa until golden crisp. Now cut the sandwich diagonally. You can do the same
for other two slices.
